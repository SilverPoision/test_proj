// Note: This project was build with most basic features as I dont wanted to
// complicate it with large production based features so please take this assumption
// in mind while revewing and if anywhere you get anything like why i have done this
// just do me a call I will explian its security perspective as this was partially
// build on security.
// Also you may notice that I have used too less packedges this is because
// I dont prefer using packdges as they migth be vulnerable to threats as
// they are build by normal developers and there are no security check performed
// unless there's a breach.
// In conculsion I want to say that this might lack my 100% as
// this was a test project but I really encoruge you to see my finished production
// code when we work together.
// thanks
